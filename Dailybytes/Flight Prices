Question:
This question is asked by Google. A company is booking flights to send its employees to its two satellite offices A and B. The cost of sending the ith employee to office A and office B is given by prices[i][0] and prices[i][1] respectively. Given that half the employees must be sent to office A and half the employees must be sent to office B, return the minimum cost the company must pay for all their employees’ flights.

Ex: Give the following prices…

prices = [[40,30],[300,200],[50,50],[30,60]], return 310
Fly the first personn to office B.
Fly the second person to office B.
Fly the third person to office A.
Fly the fourth person to office A.

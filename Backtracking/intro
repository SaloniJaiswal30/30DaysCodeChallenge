Backtracking is simliar to recursion but its an improved version of it.There are 2 main things which makes the difference

1)In Recursion we move to all possible ways. In Backtracking we does pruning. It means we are not moving ahead, if we get to know that this way wont give 
us answer(N queen problem can clearly show pruning). 

2)In backtracking after calling , we bring the input to its previous state. So that we can check all the ways(Rat and maze) and we can improve space 
complexity(print all permutations of a string)
